Topic: Community Resource Hub

Create a website that will serve as a community resource hub to highlight resources available to residents within the community (e.g., non-profits, support services, community events and programs, etc.). Your entry for this event is an exception to the general rules for the 2026 National TSA Conference regarding identifying information and you may include school or chapter name if it is the same name as the community used.
Your website should include the following: 

### An interactive directory of community resources (resource hub) that allows users to search and filter the resources. 
### A highlight section that spotlights at least three of the community resources you have listed in your resource hub. 
### A form that users can submit to indicate new resources that should be added to the community resources hub. 
### Additional content to enhance the community resource hub for end users. 

## Primary Idea
Obviously our community is in Sarasota, so its going to revlove around that. 
But what would the resources consist of? 

Hopefully the following (each being a page, having links for people):

Social & Financial Services: Food assistance, emergency housing, utilities assistance (e.g., resources from All Faiths Food Bank or Catholic Charities).

Health & Wellness: Mental health, substance abuse, medical clinics (e.g., First Step, Centerstone, Sarasota Memorial Hospital resources).

Arts & Culture: Non-profit theaters, museums, educational programs (e.g., Ringling Museum, Asolo Rep, Sarasota Orchestra youth programs).

Senior Services: Age-friendly resources, transportation, social programs (e.g., programs from Senior Friendship Centers).

Youth & Education: After-school programs, tutoring, mentorship (e.g., Boys & Girls Clubs, Sarasota County Schools resources).

Environmental & Conservation: Groups focused on the Bay, beaches, and nature preserves (e.g., Sarasota Bay Watch, Audubon organizations).

### Since Sarasota is geographically diverse (Sarasota, Venice, North Port, Siesta Key, etc.), enhance filtering (maybe with interactive map?):

Geographic Filter: Allow users to filter resources by major zones or cities within Sarasota County (e.g., Sarasota City, Venice, North Port, Longboat Key).

Near Public Transit: Reference Sarasota County Area Transit (SCAT) routes for resources accessible via public bus. Include a filter for "On or Near SCAT Route."

Sarasota Calendar Integration: Create an "Events" section that pulls in dates for events hosted by the listed non-profits (e.g., adoption events, fundraising galas, free workshops).

Local Government Links: A dedicated section linking to essential County and City government services (e.g., Clerk of the Circuit Court, Sarasota County Health Department).
